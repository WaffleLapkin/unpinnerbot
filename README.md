Telegram bot, that unpins messages that were automatically pinned. 

When a channel has a linked group, all posts from the channel are forwarded to the group **and pinned there**. This bot unpins them, effectively turning off the auto-pin feature.

forwarded from a channel to its linked group and automatically pinned in the group.
